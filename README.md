# Number-Compare
A simple project to help my 6 year old daughter compare numbers, and discourage guessing. Which number is greater or less?

My daughter is struggling with math. Unfortunately, so many of the online resources for kids do not discourage guessing. 
For example, given the question "Fill in the blank: 39 __ 89" If the child selects ">", the available platforms will simply say "Wrong. Try again", and allow the child to click the next option. Again, if the child selects "=", the same thing happens and the child is given yet another chance to answer "<" correctly. To add to this, these online platforms are generally 'game-oriented' in that your character will move forward as you answer correctly, which is actually encouraging the child to just click, click, click, until they get the answer right and see their character move to the next stage.

This number compare project is simple. There is no game, and there is no option to try again. If the question is answered incorrectly, a browser alert states that, and a new question is generated. For my daughter, she still finds the project entertaining, even though there is no 'game' aspect to it.

Additionally, the app keeps track of right and wrong answers, all the while, keeping a running score. This allows me to leave my daughter unattended, and check-in on her status.

She has now outgrown this app, because she understands the greater than/less than concept, but suprisingly, she still enjoys 'playing'.

Although it won't be part of this repository, I intend to make additional projects to aid in her schooling.

Test Resync.
